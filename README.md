# MetaMask Browser Extension (built without LavaMoat)

This is a fork of official metamask-extension repo, without any additional changes.

We're automatically building the project (whenever new release of official MetaMask is available) without LavaMoat enabled and re-releasing it.

All releases are available on [releases](https://github.com/synpress-io/metamask-extension/releases) page.
